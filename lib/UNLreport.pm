=head1 NAME

UNLreport - Formats column-oriented data into uniform column sizes

=head1 SYNOPSIS
The UNLreport provides the following methods:

  use UNLreport;
  my $report = UNLreport->new ([in_delim  => '|'],
                               [out_delim => '|'],
                               [out_file  => "<file path>"]
                               [mode      => ">" | ">>" ]
                              );
  $report->in_delim([char]);    # Sets/returns input column separator

  $report->out_delim([char]);   # Sets/returns output column separator

  $report->out_file([file_path, [mode]] );  # Sets/returns output file
                                # Also sets the output mode - Overwrite
                                # or append

  $report->fdesc();             # Returns reference to file descriptor

  $report->has_end_delim(flag); # 1 for delimiter at end of each line,
                                # 0 to omit end-of-line delimiter
                                # Default: 0
  $lines_so_far = $report + $a_line; # Splits and adds this line to the
                                     # UNLreport object.
  $lines_so_far = $report + \@values;# Adds this array - a line already
                                     # split - to the UNLreport object.
                                     # NOTE: Pass an array REFERENCE
                                     # Returns line tally so far.
  $report->print();             # Sends the data to the output file,
                                # with columns uniformly sized

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A detailed description of the module and methods follows.

All parameters to new() are optional.  They can be completely omitted
or set later.

The default value for in_delim is the vertical bar (AKA pipe), the
standard delimiter for files created with the Informix-SQL "unload"
command. You may substitute any other character eg. comma, colon,
period etc.  If you wish to specify a blank separator, use the
lower-case letter 'b' as your parameter.  Other than that b, we
obviously do not recommend using an alphanumeric character as a field
delimiter.  There is [currently] no method for specifying a pattern.

The default value for out_delim is copied from in_delim, whether using
the default in_delim or set in the new() method.  Or you can set it
using the out_delim() method. As with in_delim, do not use an alphanumeric
delimiter if you want your output to be readable. Also, the letter b will
be interpreted as a space (blank)

For methods in_delim(), out_delim(), and out_file(), supplying a
parameter sets the indicated attribute; omitting it returns the value
(Ye Olde accessor-mutator) of that attribute.  Thus, you can omit the
delimter parametes from the new() method and set them later.

Note that you can dynamically change the input column separator.  If
your data input is from different sources that use different column
separators e.g. one comma-separated file and one colon-separated file, you
can switch how the UNLreport object splits the line to follow the change.

On the other hand, the assumption is that all output is to be delimited
the same way.  Similarly, all output is targeted to the same output
file. The UNLreport object does not really care about the output column
separator or the output file until it is ready to generate the output.
Hence, it is permissible but futile to call out_delim() (or out_file()) to
set these attributes more than once; only the final call before output will
have the intended effect, overwriting the work of any previous call.

The default output file is, of course, STDOUT.  You can specify a path
here.  The default mode is '>' - to write the output as a new file,
overwriting any existing file by name name.  If that is not your
intention, use
  mode => ">>"
to append to an existing file.

You send a line to the report by using the overloaded + operator. You
may send it a line with the delimiters intact - as from an UNLOAD
command.  Or you can send it a REFERENCE to an array, as you would have
if you are doing SQL-FETCH commmands and want a neat report on the data.

=head1 HISTORY

Original version; created by h2xs release 1.23 with options:
  -XAC
    -n
    UNLreport

=head1 BACKGROUND

This module is the next stage of a script that started life as a shell
script, beautify-unl.sh.  Its purpose was to straighten out the zig-zag
columns produces by the Informix SQL command UNLOAD.  Hence, the
default columns separator is the | character, both for splitting the
input columns as well as formatting the output lines. The first Perl
attempt was UNLreport.pm, which works was not CPAN-worthy.
